This package contains a sample application that uses the awesome node.js library [apify](https://github.com/apifytech/apify-js). 

The application crawls through a list of the Holy Roman Emperors from Wikipedia and pull the name, reign start/end dates, and image url from each entry.

Run with `docker-compose up` or `npm install; npm start` and navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
